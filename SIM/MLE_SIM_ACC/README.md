## MLE SIM ACC

### Reproduction 

(1) Run script MLE_SIM_DATA.R to generate synthetic MLE data. 
(2) Run script MLE_SIM_ACC_run.R to run simulation study.
(3) Compile Rmd file MLE_SIM_ACC.Rmd to conduct analysis of results.

### Details

- Check and potentially adapt paths and design parameters initially. 
- We recommend to perform an initial test run with reduced Nsim.
